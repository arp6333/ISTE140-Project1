  <h2>Education:</h2>
        <h4>Honeoye Falls-Lima High School, Honeoye Falls NY: 2012-2016</h4>
    
    <p>Played trumpet for concert band, and played trumpet and French horn for jazz band. Art club was an afterschool program in the art rooms where students could come anytime they wanted to use art supplies freely. Extra life is an event for fundraising for Children's Miracle Network Hospitals which I would like to participate in every year.</p>
    <p>I played for the school volleyball team for 4 years which included practice every day after school for 2-3 hours along with games about once a week. Volleyball club was for 4 years as well which included going to practice twice a week for 6 hours total along with tournaments about every other week. The swim team met after school 2-3 hours every day in the opposite season of volleyball which I was in for a year.</p>

        <h4>Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester NY: 2016-Present</h4>
    <p>Currently a second year looking to join a programming club and find a co-op. I actively run every other day and skateboard around campus. I enjoy all of my programming classes I have taken such as Computer Science, Web and Mobile, and Computer Science Problem Solving. I am currently a computer science major but am looking to switch into either web and mobile or human centered computing.</p>
