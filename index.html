<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>My name is Aniela Parobek and I grew up in the small town of Honeoye Falls, NY. I have lived in Honeoye Falls since I can remember and am now attending and currently living on campus at Rochester Institute of Technology.</p>

<p>My interests include doing digital art, programming, psychology, and astronomy.</p>

<p>This website was made to show my résumé, education, and other interests in a well-organized format for professors, employers, or anyone that may like to know about me.</p>
